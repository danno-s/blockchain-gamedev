The blockchain is a wonderful technology to support the development of video games. We are fan both of blockchain and video games and we would like to raise the awareness of the fact that blockchain and associated technologies can be successfully employed to build games.

We need input to both gamers and game developers. 

# 2 minutes to fill a survey

We have designed two forms, one meant for users, and another for developers of games using blockchain technologies. Filling one out does not take more than a couple of minutes, and your answers would make the World a better place.

Here are both forms:
- [For Developers](https://goo.gl/forms/uozjYFGHQAukgBFS2)
- [For Players](https://goo.gl/forms/GPK2PsbrSLGIEban1)

# Why are we doing this?

We would like to have an understanding of the motivation (i) to build games using blockchain technologies and (ii) to play games that use blockchain.

Results of these survey will be disseminated to academic and professional venues. The effort is conducted at the University of Chile.
